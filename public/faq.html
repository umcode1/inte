        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>
          Generative AI refers to systems capable of creating new and original content, such as text, images, or music, by analyzing patterns in existing data. 
          It uses advanced machine learning models to perform tasks that require creativity and problem-solving, making it a revolutionary force across industries.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Core Technologies Behind Generative AI</h3>
      
        <h4>2.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Invented by:</strong> Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.<br>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> GANs consist of two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator — that work in opposition.<br>
          <strong>Functionality:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <strong>generator</strong> creates synthetic data.</li>
          <li>The <strong>discriminator</strong> evaluates the data to distinguish between real and synthetic.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Applications:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Image synthesis (e.g., DeepFake technology).</li>
          <li>Video generation.</li>
          <li>Style transfer in artwork.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>2.2 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Probabilistic models that encode data into latent representations and then decode them back into synthetic data.<br>
          <strong>Key Features:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unlike GANs, VAEs ensure the generated data is continuous and diverse.</li>
          <li>Used in generating realistic images, audio, and chemical compound structures.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>2.3 Diffusion Models</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Emerging Technique:</strong> These models gradually transform random noise into structured outputs, often outperforming GANs in image synthesis tasks.<br>
          <strong>Applications:</strong> Text-to-image models like <strong>DALL-E</strong> and <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> leverage this approach.
        </p>
      
        <h4>2.4 Large Language Models (LLMs)</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Examples:</strong> GPT, BERT, PaLM.<br>
          <strong>Functionality:</strong> Train on vast corpora of text data to generate coherent, contextually relevant text. These models can summarize, translate, and generate creative or technical content.
